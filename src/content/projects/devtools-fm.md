# DevTools FM

DevTools FM is a podcast I co-host that explores the world of developer tools. We interview the creators behind the tools developers use every day, diving deep into the technical and human aspects of building software for developers.

## What We Cover

- **Tool deep-dives**: How popular dev tools are built and maintained
- **Creator stories**: The people and journeys behind the tools
- **Industry trends**: What's happening in the developer tools ecosystem
- **Community building**: How to grow and sustain open source projects

## Why DevTools?

Developer tools are fascinating because they're software built for people who build software. The design constraints, technical challenges, and community dynamics are unique. Plus, the people who build these tools are incredibly thoughtful and passionate.

# Parsing Techniques Overview

This is a living document exploring different parsing techniques I've been studying during my time at the Recurse Center.

## Types of Parsers

### Recursive Descent

- Hand-written, top-down approach
- Easy to understand and debug
- Natural mapping to grammar rules
- Used in many production compilers (Rust, Go, etc.)

### LR Parsing

- Bottom-up, table-driven
- More powerful than recursive descent
- Can be harder to generate good error messages
- Generated by tools like yacc, bison

### Parser Combinators

- Functional approach to parsing
- Compose small parsers into larger ones
- Popular in functional languages (Haskell, F#)
- Can be elegant but sometimes slower

## Key Insights

The choice of parsing technique depends on:

- Language complexity
- Error message quality requirements
- Development time vs runtime performance tradeoffs
- Team familiarity

## Further Reading

- "Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom
- Dragon Book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools)
- Papers on PEG parsers and error recovery
